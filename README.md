Here are the top reasons:
1. Cloud-based machine learning keeps you focused on the current best practices.
2. In this course, you will learn the most useful algorithms.  Don’t waste your time sifting through mountains of techniques that are in the wild
4. Cloud-based service is straightforward to integrate with your application and has support for a wide variety of programming languages.
5. Whether you have small data or big data, the elastic nature of the AWS cloud allows you to handle them all.
6. There is also No upfront cost or commitment – Pay only for what you need and use  

### Hands-on Labs  

In this course, you will learn with hands-on labs and work on exciting and challenging problems

What exactly will you learn in this course?

Here are the things that you will learn in this course:

### AWS SageMaker
* You will learn how to deploy a Notebook instance on the AWS Cloud.
* You will gain insight into algorithms provided by SageMaker service
* Learn how to train, optimize and deploy your models

### AI Services
In the AI Services section of this course,
* You will learn about a set of pre-trained services that you can directly integrate with your application.
* Within a few minutes, you can build image and video analysis applications – like face recognition
* You can develop solutions for natural language processing, like finding sentiment, text translation, and conversational chatbots.
